# JavaProgram to update and get the Employee details
There are 2 classes one is Emp1 class and the other one is Mainclass.
The Emp1 class has all the buisness logics and Mainclass contains the real entity.
Emp1 class I have giventhedatemembers like name, age, salary and designation which are required to create the methods like Create,Display, Raisesalary and Exit from the page.
In the main class I have created the object of the Emp1 class and call the methods which are written inside the Emp1 class to get the required output.
