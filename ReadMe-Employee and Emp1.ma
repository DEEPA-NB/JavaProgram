Employee details by giving designation and salary.

Here I have created 5 classes employee, clerk, programmer, manager and emp1

Employee class consist of logics for entering employee name and age dynamically

       public Employee()
  {
    System.out.println("Enter Name");
    name=sc.next();
    System.out.println("Enter Age");
    age=sc.nextInt();
  }
